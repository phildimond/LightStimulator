# LightStimulator
 
Code and KiCad hardware design for replacement electronics for a LightStim LED Light Therapy device where the guts had blown up.

Stupidly simple fix, better than the $200 replacement cost.

Code is for a Seed Studio Xiao ESP32C3 because it's small and I had one. It's Arduino on Platform IO so trivial to adapt to something else.
